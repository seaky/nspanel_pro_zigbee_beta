     * Sends a route request packet that creates routes from every node in the
     * network back to this node. This function should be called by an application
     * that wishes to communicate with many nodes, for example, a gateway, central
     * monitor, or controller. A device using this function was referred to as an
     * 'aggregator' in EmberZNet 2.x and earlier, and is referred to as a
     * 'concentrator' in the ZigBee specification and EmberZNet 3.  This function
     * enables large scale networks, because the other devices do not have to
     * individually perform bandwidth-intensive route discoveries. Instead, when a
     * remote node sends an APS unicast to a concentrator, its network layer
     * automatically delivers a special route record packet first, which lists the
     * network ids of all the intermediate relays. The concentrator can then use
     * source routing to send outbound APS unicasts. (A source routed message is one
     * in which the entire route is listed in the network layer header.) This allows
     * the concentrator to communicate with thousands of devices without requiring
     * large route tables on neighboring nodes.  This function is only available in
     * ZigBee Pro (stack profile 2), and cannot be called on end devices. Any router
     * can be a concentrator (not just the coordinator), and there can be multiple
     * concentrators on a network.  Note that a concentrator does not automatically
     * obtain routes to all network nodes after calling this function. Remote
     * applications must first initiate an inbound APS unicast.  Many-to-one routes
     * are not repaired automatically. Instead, the concentrator application must
     * call this function to rediscover the routes as necessary, for example, upon
     * failure of a retried APS message. The reason for this is that there is no
